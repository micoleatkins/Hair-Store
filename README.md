#### **_Future Updates_**:

1. I plan on customizing the user's portal to see past purchases, liked items, and existing carts.
2. Adding payment methods like paypal, klarna, and affirm to the site for customers to checkout.
3. Allowing customers that's not signed into their portal to still be able to checkout as a guest.
